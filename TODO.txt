- Remove MotionWrapper keys - currentQuestion, maxQuestion and replace with something else
- Move MotionWrapper outside Quiz.tsx and in myQuiz.tsx (potentially)
- Add QuizButton component and try to handle some state inside (e.g. immediately showing the correct answer, highlighting of answer correctness, etc)
- Split revealAnswer config option into revealCurrentAnswer and revealAllAnswers
- Move "newpage" option of revealAnswer into it's own "showAnswerExplainer" option, as we may want to either immediately show the correct answer + provide an explainer, or not show it, but provide the answer in an explainer
- Document the various ways to configure the quiz - config object / quiz json
- Sort out answer button keys: <Quiz.AnswerButton key={currentQuestionData.question + index} index={index}>
- Add timer
- Add progress bar
- Add option to keep trying answers till you get the correct one (i.e. only show the correct value for the current answer, not all)
- Add delay config option
- Warn about weird combinations of config options ? explain default behavior in docs?
  * personality quiz type && showAnswerExplainer: true - should be allowed
  * personality quiz type && revealAnswer: true
  * showAnswerExplainer: true && nextButton: true
- Adding next button manually to quiz shows it even though it can't be used - figure out what to do (if anything)
- Exit animation for each question doesn't trigger anymore for some reason
- Figure out key prop error in browser console
- Create ExplainerNext button and rename nextButton to QuestionNextButton
