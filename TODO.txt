- PROBABLY NOT NEEDED: Automatically generate IDs for questions and answers (so we can avoid passing key like this: <Quiz.AnswerButton key={index} index={index}>) - using index seems fine as these are in a static order in the DOM.
- LOW PRIORITY: Split revealAnswer config option into revealCurrentAnswer and revealAllAnswers
- LOW PRIORITY: Fix myQuizComposed (try to pass classnames to wrapper components)
- LOW PRIORITY: Expose entire animation component tree as a custom component so that users can provide their own motion wrappers and AnimatePresense values
- LOW PRIORITY: Add 'inTransition' state which prevents interaction in all buttons, as clicking during transitions can bug out the quiz. It's low priority as it's realistically very hard to click on anything during a transition
- TO CONFIRM THIS EXISTS IN REALISTIC USE CASE: Bug - potential bug when moving from explainer (on a new page) after the last question, to the Result slide. The explainer gets pushed down for some reason
- TO CONFIRM THIS EXISTS IN REALISTIC USE CASE: If you click too quickly (during the transition between questions/explainer), the quiz bugs out. Add state to disable actions while in transition?
- Add timer
- Add option to keep trying answers till you get the correct one (i.e. only show the correct value for the current answer, not all)
- Warn about weird combinations of config options ? explain default behavior in docs?
  * personality quiz type && revealAnswer: true
- Move types from QuizContext to their own file
- Find a way to use more accessible answer buttons (radio/checkboxes for single/multiple select), weigh against more complicated usage of own custom components
- Create types for the quiz JSON
- Replace react context with Zustand https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction (this will allow us to remove the provider wrapper)
- Add shuffling of Answers (and maybe questions)
- Create example designs
- Consider renaming 'state' prop that is being passed to all child components
