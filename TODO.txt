- Remove MotionWrapper keys - currentQuestion, maxQuestion and replace with something else
- Move MotionWrapper outside Quiz.tsx and in myQuiz.tsx (potentially)
- Add QuizButton component and try to handle some state inside (e.g. immediately showing the correct answer, highlighting of answer correctness, etc)
- Split revealAnswer config option into revealCurrentAnswer and revealAllAnswers
- Document the various ways to configure the quiz - config object / quiz json
- Sort out answer button keys: <Quiz.AnswerButton key={currentQuestionData.question + index} index={index}>
- Add timer
- Add progress bar
- Add option to keep trying answers till you get the correct one (i.e. only show the correct value for the current answer, not all)
- Add delay config option
- Warn about weird combinations of config options ? explain default behavior in docs?
  * personality quiz type && showAnswerExplainer: true - should be allowed
  * personality quiz type && revealAnswer: true
  * showAnswerExplainer: true && nextButton: true
- Adding next button manually to quiz shows it even though it can't be used - figure out what to do (if anything - hide it?).
- Move MotionWrapper outside of Quiz.tsx into myQuiz, pass it as prop into each quiz page. 
This way there's no need to have <AnimatePresence mode="popLayout"> outside too. Pass in AnimatePresence mode too as a prop.
- Figure out how to set the explainer to be displayed below the question, or on a new page alternatively - already done?
- If explainer is shown on a new page, nextButton needs to go to explainer page instead of next question - done?
- Create separate context that deals with answers ?

- Replace react context with Zustand https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction (this will allow us to remove the provider wrapper)
- Combine currentQuestion and currentQuestionData (add index to currentQuestionData and rename to currentQuestion) - what about index starting with 0?
- Create useAnswerButton so that users can use a regular button instead of <AnswerButton>
- Rename nextButton setting to autoResumeOnAnswer and add autoResumeDelay
- Explainer Next button seems to be buggy, when autoResumeOnAnswer/nextButton is true, it advances the question but the quiz bugs out
- Bug: question changes before animation has played. Animation plays for new questions only
- Automatically generate IDs for questions and answers (so we can avoid passing key like this: <Quiz.AnswerButton key={currentQuestionData.question + index} index={index}>)
- Bug(?): if you answer the question while the enter animation is playing, the quiz bugs out
- Use 'is' prefix for boolean values, e.g. isAnswerBtnDisabled
- If you click too quickly (during the transition between questions/explainer), the quiz bugs out. Add state to disable actions while in transition?
