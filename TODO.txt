- PROBABLY NOT NEEDED: Automatically generate IDs for questions and answers (so we can avoid passing key like this: <Quiz.AnswerButton key={index} index={index}>) - using index seems fine as these are in a static order in the DOM.
- LOW PRIORITY: Split revealAnswer config option into revealCurrentAnswer and revealAllAnswers
- LOW PRIORITY: Fix myQuizComposed (try to pass classnames to wrapper components)
- LOW PRIORITY: Expose entire animation component tree as a custom component so that users can provide their own motion wrappers and AnimatePresense values
- TO CONFIRM THIS EXISTS IN REALISTIC USE CASE: Bug - potential bug when moving from explainer (on a new page) after the last question, to the Result slide. The explainer gets pushed down for some reason
- TO CONFIRM THIS EXISTS IN REALISTIC USE CASE: If you click too quickly (during the transition between questions/explainer), the quiz bugs out. Add state to disable actions while in transition?
- Add timer
- Add option to keep trying answers till you get the correct one (i.e. only show the correct value for the current answer, not all)
- Warn about weird combinations of config options ? explain default behavior in docs?
  * personality quiz type && revealAnswer: true
- Find a way to use more accessible answer buttons (radio/checkboxes for single/multiple select), weigh against more complicated usage of own custom components
- Replace react context with Zustand https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction (this will allow us to remove the provider wrapper)
- Add shuffling of Answers (and maybe questions)
- Create example designs
- Adding next button manually to quiz shows it even though it can't be used - figure out what to do (if anything - hide it?).
- Combine currentQuestion and currentQuestionData (add index to currentQuestionData and rename to currentQuestion) - what about index starting with 0?
- Use 'is' prefix for boolean values, e.g. isAnswerBtnDisabled
- Rename animations to slideLeft and slideUp
